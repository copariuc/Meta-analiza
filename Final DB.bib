title={Relationships between Bullying Behaviours and the Dark Triad: A Study with Adults},
journal={Personality and Individual Differences},
abstract={The current study is the first to directly investigate relationships between the Dark Triad personality traits and bullying behaviours. We also sought to design a reliable measure of bullying for use with an adult sample. The sample consisted of 657 participants (203 males; 454 females), aged 18 to 70 (M=23.1, SD=8.65). Participants completed the Short-D3, a measure of the Dark Triad personality traits, as well as a Bullying Questionnaire which was constructed for this study. Correlational analyses demonstrated that psychopathy was most strongly related to bullying, followed by Machiavellianism, and narcissism. However, our predictions for the differential correlations between the Dark Triad facets and bullying type were generally not supported. Implications are discussed.},

abstract={The goal of this paper was to assess the connection between dark personality traits and engagement in harmful online behaviors in a sample of Russian Facebook users, and to describe the language they use in online communication. A total of 6724 individuals participated in the study (mean age~=~44.96 years, age range: 18\textendash 85 years, 77.9\% \textemdash{} female). Data was collected via a purpose-built application, which served two purposes: administer the survey and download consenting user's public wall posts, gender and age from the Facebook profile. The survey included questions on engagement in harmful online behaviors and the Short Dark Triad scale; 15,281 wall posts from 1972 users were included in the dataset. These posts were subjected to morphological, lexical and semantic analyses. More than 25\% of the sample reported engaging in harmful online behaviors. Males were more likely to send insulting or threatening messages and post aggressive comments; no gender differences were found for disseminating other people's private information. Psychopathy and male gender were the unique predictors of engagement in harmful online behaviors. A number of significant correlations were found between the dark traits and numeric, lexical, morphological and semantic characteristics of the participants' posts.},

journal={Personality and Individual Differences},
abstract={Trolling behaviours on social networking sites (SNSs) are problematic for other computer mediated communication users, as the psychological effects of experiencing trolling online are considered similar to the psychological effects of offline harassment. The current study explored personality traits and social motivations associated with individuals who engage in online trolling, specifically on the SNS Facebook\textregistered. The Dark Tetrad personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism) and social reward (specifically, negative social potency) were examined for their predictive utility of trolling behaviours on Facebook\textregistered. A sample of 396 adults (75.9\% women, 24.1\% men) aged between 18 and 77years of age (M=34.41, SD=1.70) completed the Global Assessment of Facebook\textregistered{} Trolling (GAFT), The Dirty Dozen, The Short Sadistic Impulse Scale, and The Social Rewards Questionnaire. Results showed that trait psychopathy and sadism predict Facebook\textregistered{} trolling behaviours; however, negative social potency had the strongest predictive utility. These results show that individual trolling behaviour may be better explained by negative social reward motivation than negative personality traits. In addition, these findings offer practical implications for SNS administrators and everyday users of SNSs. Future research should continue to explore predictors of this understudied antisocial online behaviour.},

title={Tweet Valence, Volume of Abuse, and Observers' Dark Tetrad Personality Factors Influence Victim-Blaming and the Perceived Severity of Twitter Cyberabuse},
journal={Computers in Human Behavior Reports},
abstract={Previous research into Twitter cyberabuse has yielded several findings: victim-blaming (VB) was influenced by victims' initial tweet-valence; perceived severity (PS) was influenced independently by tweet valence and abuse volume; VB and PS were predicted by observer narcissism and psychopathy. However, this previous research was limited by its narrow focus on celebrity victims, and lack of consideration of observer sadism. The current study investigated 125 observers' VB and PS perceptions of lay-user cyberabuse, and influence of observers' Dark Tetrad scores (psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism, sadism). We manipulated initial-tweet valence (negative, neutral, positive) and received abuse volume (low, high). Our results indicated that VB was highest following negative initial tweets; VB was higher following high-volume abuse. PS did not differ across initial-tweet valences; PS was greater following a high abuse volume. Regression analyses revealed that observer sadism predicted VB across initial-tweet valences; psychopathy predicted PS when initial tweets were `emotive' (negative, positive), whereas Machiavellianism predicted PS when they were neutral. Our results show that perceptions of lay-user abuse are influenced interactively by victim-generated content and received abuse volume. Our current results contrast with perceptions of celebrity-abuse, which is mostly determined by victim-generated content. Findings are contextualised within the Warranting Theory of impression formation.},

title={`I Did It for the LULZ': How the Dark Personality Predicts Online Disinhibition and Aggressive Online Behavior in Adolescence},
journal={Computers in Human Behavior},
abstract={A large proportion of youth believe that the world of cyberspace provides them with a relatively safe and anonymous digital bubble ripe for uninhibited self-expression. At the same time, observers have noted an increase of individuals behaving in an unrestrained manner on the Internet, while researchers have reported elevated rates of cyber aggressive behavior. What remains unclear, however, is whether, and how, disinhibition might be related to cyber aggression. In an aim to explore the possible associations, a large sample (total N = 709) of high school (M age = 15.56 years) respondents from New Zealand were recruited, and completed a survey featuring scales assessing personality and technology behaviors, attitudes, habits, and trends. The present study was designed to investigate whether the three dark personality traits of narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism would predict false self perceptions, and in sequence, online disinhibition and aggressive online behavior. All three dark personality traits, as well as false self, were positively associated with online disinhibition. Perceptions of false self were found to be a significant predictor of cyber aggression when mediated by online disinhibition. In the case of cyber aggression, however, psychopathy, sadistic traits, and online disinhibition were found to be significant predictors of this outcome. The results collectively provide a more nuanced understanding of how antisocial personality traits are associated with maladaptive identity formation (i.e., endorsement of false self beliefs) as well as maladaptive online behavior. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

title={The Dark Triad and Facebook Surveillance: How Machiavellianism, Psychopathy, but Not Narcissism Predict Using Facebook to Spy on Others},
journal={Computers in Human Behavior},
abstract={The Dark Triad of personality \textendash{} Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy \textendash{} has been shown to influence a variety of behaviours. Typically, high levels of these traits predict engaging in behaviour at the periphery of what is considered socially normative. Such individuals do not display clinical maladaptation however, and function relatively normally. The Dark Triad's influence extends to the online context, where it predicts questionable behaviour when using social media such as Facebook. For example it can affect the content of users' status updates, or what media they post. In this paper we examine a new concept known as Facebook surveillance. This details the deliberate examination of users' profiles in order to gather information for one's own advantage. We suggest this is distinct with the conventional viewing of ones ``feed'' (which has little intent), or the stalking of ex-romantic partners (which has a emotive component). We predicted that Machiavellianism and psychopathy would both predict Facebook surveillance, whereas narcissism would not. Furthermore, we postulated that the Machiavellianism-surveillance relationship would be mediated by endorsement of gossip, whereas for psychopathy it would be mediated by intolerance for uncertainty. 259 participants took part in an online survey to measure these traits. Results supported our hypotheses, and suggested two forms of surveillance \textendash{} Facebook tracking, which was more recreational, and Facebook investigating, which was more deliberate and targeted. Future studies are then discussed which may use more complex measures of narcissism, and gather behavioural and/or qualitative measures of surveillance.},

journal={Journal of Personality},
abstract={Abstract Objective This research seeks to clarify the association between online trolling and sadistic personality, and to provide evidence that the reward and rationalization processes at work in sadism are likewise manifest in online trolling. Method Online respondents (community adults and university students; total N = 1,715) completed self-report measures of personality and trolling behavior. They subsequently engaged in one of two judgment tasks. In Study 1, respondents viewed stimuli depicting scenes of emotional/physical suffering and provided ratings of (a) perceived pain intensity and (b) pleasure experienced while viewing the photos. In Study 2, the iTroll questionnaire was developed and validated. It was then administered alongside a moral judgment task. Results Across both studies, online trolling was strongly associated with a sadistic personality profile. Moreover, sadism and trolling predicted identical patterns of pleasure and harm minimization. The incremental contribution of sadism was sustained even when controlling for broader antisocial tendencies (i.e., the Dark Triad, callous-unemotionality, and trait aggression). Conclusions Results confirm that online trolling is motivated (at least in part) by sadistic tendencies. Coupled with effective rationalization mechanisms, sadistic pleasure can be consummated in such everyday behaviors as online trolling.},

abstract={Cyberbullying is a growing problem in the fast-evolving world of social media. Although this problem has been studied extensively, there is relatively little research examining it from the angle of the dark tetrad (i.e., psychopathy, Machiavellianism, sadism, and narcissism), especially across different ethnicities. In other words, this research makes original contribution by exploring the predictive ability of the dark tetrad traits in individuals of different ethnicities and their subsequent willingness to engage in cyberbullying. The study (n = 1,464) explores whether there is a positive association between the dark tetrad personality traits and cyberbullying. The results reveal that all four traits predict cyberbullying in participants from across three different ethnicities (Asian, black, and white). Furthermore, female participants score less than their male counterparts across all four traits. Researchers, academics, and legislators might potentially benefit from this research by considering focusing their interventions on helping offenders minimize the display of certain personality traits, thus taking steps toward cyberbullying reduction. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.},

journal={Personality and Individual Differences},
abstract={The Dark Tetrad traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, sadism) are associated with antisocial online behaviors. However, the mediating role of these behaviors between the Dark Tetrad and problematic social media use (PSMU) is unclear. Among a sample of 761 participants, we investigated direct and indirect associations of the Dark Tetrad traits with PSMU via cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and cybertrolling. Multiple mediation analyses demonstrated cyberbullying and cyberstalking fully mediated the relationship between Machiavellianism and PSMU in the total sample and among men. Narcissism was indirectly associated with PSMU via cyberstalking in the total sample and among women. The relationship between sadism and PSMU was fully explained by cyberbullying and cyberstalking in the total sample. Cybertrolling was associated with sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, although it was not related to PSMU. We suggest that antisocial online behaviors may provide an explanation for the relationship between dark personality traits and PSMU with different behaviors mediating different traits among men and women. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Personality factors, such as the Dark Tetrad personality factors (Machiavellianism, narcissism and sadism) relate to greater online trolling. Other personality factors, such as the Big Five Personality factors, honesty\textendash humility and negative social potency, may also play a role in cyber-bullying, which is an aggressive behavior similar to trolling. The purpose of this study was to predict Facebook trolling behavior based on personality factors. A total of 139 participants com-pleted a survey on their online behavior and personality factors. Online trolling behavior positively correlated with sadism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism, and negatively correlated with agree-ableness, conscientiousness and honesty\textendash humility. A hierarchical linear regression showed that sadism, Machiavellianism and negative social potency were the only unique predictors of online trolling behavior. Trolling was unrelated to the frequency of Facebook use and the frequency of commenting. Enjoyment of trolling fully mediated the relationship between Machiavellianism and the trolling behavior. The results thus suggested that Facebook trolling behaviors may be motivated by enjoying the manipulation of others. \textcopyright{} 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Machiavellianism is a personality trait characterized by cynicism, emotional detachment and a willingness to manipulate others. Research investigating the behavior of Machiavellian men and women has focused on its influence in offline relationships. The popularity of social networking sites suggests that it is also important to consider the interactions of Machiavellian men and women in this context as well. Men (N = 54) and women (N = 189) completed questionnaires assessing Machiavellianism, self-monitoring, self-promotion and relational aggression. Analyses revealed that women who were high in Machiavellianism engaged in more dishonest self-promotion and relational aggression towards a close friend on Facebook whilst males with high levels of Machiavellianism engaged in more self-promoting behavior. In addition, both men and women high in Machiavellianism engaged in more self-monitoring. The findings demonstrate the importance of considering the influence of personality on online behavior and associated gender differences. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Online dating continues to grow in popularity and is associated with significant advantages; however, experiencing antisocial behaviours when online dating is a distinct possibility. The aim of the current study was to explore the utility of gender and the dark personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism in predicting perpetration of a range of antisocial behaviours on the popular dating app Tinder. It was hypothesised that the male gender and higher scores on these personality traits would predict perpetration of antisocial behaviours on Tinder. Participants (N = 587; 21\% men, 79\% women) completed an online questionnaire, including the Antisocial Uses of Tinder\textregistered{} Scale which was constructed to measure a range of antisocial behaviours. Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analyses revealed three forms of antisocial behaviours (General, esteem, and sexual) which explained over half of the variance (58.99\%) of variance in the Antisocial Uses of Tinder\textregistered{} measure. Regression analyses were run for each form of antisocial behaviour, and the predictive utility of gender and the dark traits were found to differ across the antisocial behaviours. Results of the current study support an individual differences approach to exploring antisocial behaviours online, particularly when online dating. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

title={Are Sex Differences in Antisocial and Prosocial Facebook Use Explained by Narcissism and Relational Self-Construal?},
journal={Computers in Human Behavior},
abstract={Previous research has found that some people use Facebook for antisocial purposes, such as for ``trolling'' or attention-seeking. Conversely, others use Facebook in prosocial, relationship-enhancing ways, such as to increase belonging or to connect with friends. Few studies, however, have investigated differences between men and women in their antisocial and prosocial use of Facebook. The present study sought to address this research gap by examining whether these sex differences might be explained by narcissism and relational self-construal (i.e., the extent to which an individual defines their self in terms of close relationships). To this end, 573 participants living in the United States completed measures of narcissism, relational self-construal, and motives for using Facebook. Results revealed that men reported more antisocial motives for using Facebook than did women, which was explained by their greater narcissism. Conversely, women reported stronger prosocial motives for using Facebook, which was explained by their more relational self-construal. We discuss ways that these findings can contribute to the development of interventions to promote prosocial online behaviour. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

title={The Association between Problematic Social Networking Site Use, Dark Triad Traits, and Emotion Dysregulation},
journal={BMC Psychology},
abstract={Background: Social networking sites (SNSs) allow people to socially connect with each other, collaborate, and share information. However, problematic SNS use (PSNSU) may be associated with negative personality traits. The present study investigated the associations between PSNSU, dark triad personality traits, and emotion dysregulation. Method: In the present study, 555 SNS users (Mage = 33.32 years, SD = 10.88) completed an online survey comprising measures of PSNSU, dark triad personality traits, and emotion dysregulation. Results: Bivariate correlations showed that PSNSU was significantly associated with dark triad traits as well as emotion dysregulation. Structural equation modelling (where the effect of the dark triad traits on PSNSU was mediated by emotion dysregulation) showed that 33.5\% of the variance of PSNSU was explained by Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism. Conclusion: The findings provide suggestive evidence of why PSNSU may occur as a function of the presence of dark triad traits and emotion dysregulation. The study also highlighted the important role that emotion regulation plays in the association between dark triad traits and PSNSU. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

journal={Personality and Individual Differences},
abstract={Different personality traits are correlated with problematic internet use and online gaming. However, associations between dark personality traits and problematic online gaming (POG) have received less attention. The present study investigated direct and indirect associations of the Dark Tetrad traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, sadism) with POG via online gaming motives (controlling for hours spent gaming) among 421 online gamers. Mediation analyses showed narcissism was indirectly associated with POG via online gaming motives of escape and fantasy among role-playing game players and the total sample. Sadism was directly associated with POG among first-person shooter game players and indirectly with POG via online gaming motives of escape and fantasy among role-playing game players and the total sample. The findings suggest that dark traits should also be taken into account when considering theoretical models involving problematic gaming use, online gaming motives, and preference for different games. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

journal={Journal of Interpersonal Violence},
abstract={Dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, spitefulness, and sadism) are associated with adverse childhood experiences and deviant online behaviors. However, their mediating role between childhood emotional abuse and cyberbullying has never previously been investigated. We examined direct and indirect associations of childhood emotional abuse and cyberbullying via dark personality traits among 772 participants. Men were better characterized by dark personality traits and were more likely to engage in cyberbullying than women, and there were no sex differences in childhood emotional abuse. Collectively, dark traits fully mediated the relationship between childhood emotional abuse and cyberbullying in men, with partial mediation in the total sample and women. More specifically, Machiavellianism and spitefulness were mediators in both samples, sadism was a mediator in men and the total sample, and psychopathy was a mediator in the total sample and women. The dark personality traits can account for the association between childhood emotional abuse and cyberbullying, especially among men. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2019.},

journal={Journal of Behavioral Addictions},
abstract={Background and aims: Research has shown that personality traits play an important role in problematic internet use (PIU). However, the relationship between dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, sadism, and spitefulness) and PIU has yet to be investigated. Consequently, the objectives of this study were to investigate the relationships of dark traits with specific online activities (i.e., social media, gaming, gambling, shopping, and sex) and PIU. Methods: A total of 772 university students completed a self-report survey, including the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen Scale, Short Sadistic Impulse Scale, Spitefulness Scale, and an adapted version of the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale. Results: Hierarchical regression analysis and a multiple mediation model indicated that being male was positively associated with higher online gaming, online sex, and online gambling, and negatively associated with social media and online shopping. Narcissism was related to higher social media use; Machiavellianism was related to higher online gaming, online sex, and online gambling; sadism was related to online sex; and spitefulness was associated with online sex, online gambling, and online shopping. Finally, Machiavellianism and spitefulness were directly and indirectly associated with PIU via online gambling, online gaming, and online shopping, and narcissism was indirectly associated with PIU through social media use. Discussion: Findings of this preliminary study show that individuals high in dark personality traits may be more vulnerable in developing problematic online use and that further research is warranted to examine the associations of dark personality traits with specific types of problematic online activities. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Author(s).},

journal={Personality and Individual Differences},
abstract={No longer conceptualised as only for the ``desperate'', online dating offers many benefits over face-to-face dating. Accompanying the benefits of online dating is the potential for new, distinct forms of antisocial behaviour online, such as trolling. The current study (N = 357) sought to explore the antisocial behaviour of trolling on Location-Based Real-Time Dating applications (i.e., LBRTD apps) in an online sample of Australians sourced from the community. Specifically, we examined the role of participant's sex and of the personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, sadism, and impulsivity in predicting perpetration of trolling behaviours on LBRTD apps. Although there were no sex differences, the traits of psychopathy, sadism, and dysfunctional impulsivity were significantly associated with trolling behaviours. Subsequent moderation analysis revealed that dysfunctional impulsivity predicts perpetration of trolling, but only if the individual has medium or high levels of trait psychopathy. Results of the current study aid in further conceptualising the personality of the Internet ``troll''. Future research should further explore antisocial online behaviours, such as other hostile behaviour that occurs on LBRTD apps. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

journal={Personality and Individual Differences},
abstract={In an attempt to address inconsistency in the literature regarding narcissism and online antisocial behaviour, we applied the theory of threatened egotism and aggression to examine whether anger moderates the relationship between narcissism and antisocial behaviour on Tinder. Specifically, we explored anger moderating the relationship between narcissistic subtypes of Grandiose Exhibitionism and Entitlement Exploitative and perpetration of antisocial behaviour (aggression and harassment) on Tinder. Tinder users (N = 1,001; 46.3\% men and 53.7\% women) with an average age of 22.42 years (SD = 4.31) completed an anonymous online questionnaire. Anger was a significant moderator of all relationships between narcissism and antisocial behaviour. Specifically, at average and high levels of anger there were positive, significant relationships between both facets of narcissism, and aggression and harassment on Tinder. These results indicate that trait narcissism alone may not explain perpetration of antisocial behaviour on Tinder, and to adequately explore this relationship future research should consider the role of threatened egotism. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

journal={Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking},
abstract={Internet trolling is commonly defined as disruptive online behavior, intended to provoke and distress others for amusement. Previous research has shown that gender (specifically, male), trait psychopathy, and trait sadism significantly predict engaging in trolling. In this study, we sought to replicate and extend previous research by exploring the role of self-esteem in predicting trolling, and possible interactions between self-esteem and personality. Participants (n = 400, 67.5 percent women, average age = 24.97 years [SD = 8.84]) completed an online questionnaire, including measures of psychopathy, sadism, self-esteem, and trolling behaviors. Results corroborated previous research showing gender (male) to be a significant predictor of trolling, and trait psychopathy and sadism to be significant positive predictors. Although self-esteem had no additional value on top of trait psychopathy and sadism in explaining trolling, there was a significant interaction between self-esteem and trait sadism. A moderation analysis indicated a positive relationship between self-esteem and trolling, but only when trait sadism was high. These results portray the troll as a callous individual may enjoy causing psychological harm, particularly if their self-esteem is high. These results contribute to building the psychological profile of trolls and provide future directions for research exploring trolling behaviors. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.},

Five hundred and thirteen participants (51.1\% females) completed questionnaires to assess their level of DT personality traits, loneliness, and internet trolling behavior. Results revealed that each of the DT personality traits and loneliness were positive predictors of internet trolling. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that higher levels of loneliness were positively associated with internet trolling in high Machiavellianism individuals. Additionally, higher levels of loneliness were positively associated with internet trolling in high psychopathy individuals. These results provide new evidence of the moderating role of loneliness on the relationship between DT personality traits and internet trolling behavior and may provide useful insights into the development and mitigation of this antisocial online response. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The present study examined the relationships of Dark Triad personality traits to cyber aggression in a college student sample (N = 297). Machiavellian, narcissistic (both grandiose and vulnerable forms), and psychopathic traits positively related to cyber aggression perpetration. A hierarchical multiple regression including gender, age, and Dark Triad traits found that only the erratic lifestyle component of psychopathic traits explained unique variance in cyber aggression perpetration. Gender did not moderate the relationships between Dark Triad traits and cyber aggression. These findings add to the literature on cyber aggression among college students, suggesting that psychopathic traits are a useful predictor. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2020 Springer Publishing Company, LLC.},

journal={Communication Research Reports},
abstract={The recent and rapid growth of user engagement on online and social media platforms has attracted increasing attention from communication scholars. Troublingly, little is known about the relationship between ``dark'' personalities and online communication behavior. There is a distinct need for communication scholars to investigate the impact of anti-social personality traits on computer- mediated communication behavior. To address this, we conducted a survey (N = 147) among undergraduate students living in the US to identify the association between the three Dark Triad personality traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) and six computer-mediated communication outcomes (e.g., compulsive Internet behavior, opinion leadership, perceived anonymity, media trust, social media self-presentation, and psychological reactance). We also examine gender as a potential moderator. These findings show a distinct relationship between Dark Triad personality traits and computer-mediated communication outcomes, highlighting the importance of considering these psychological individual differences in future research in this area. \textcopyright{} 2020 Eastern Communication Association.},

title={Same Personality, New Ways to Abuse: How Dark Tetrad Personalities Are Connected With Cyber Intimate Partner Violence},
journal={Journal of Interpersonal Violence},
abstract={New technologies bring new forms of intimate partner violence (IPV) or abuse, such as cyber intimate partner violence (C-IPV). This is a contemporary issue with different consequences from in-person IPV. C-IPV is a complex phenomenon triggered by a number of factors, including personality traits such as the Dark Tetrad, composed of four ``malevolent'' qualities: subclinical narcissism, Machiavellianism, subclinical psychopathy, and everyday sadism. The Dark Tetrad plays an important role in predicting the perpetration or victimization of the resulting pervasive behaviors. Although the correlations between in-person IPV and the Dark Tetrad have been studied before, to our knowledge this investigation is the first to look at the links between these four dark personality traits and C-IPV. With a sample of 1,189 participants, we measured C-IPV victimization and perpetration rates and compared the results with the Dark Tetrad profiles of the respondents. To analyze these correlations, we conducted bivariate analysis and structural equation modeling. The analysis yielded positive relations of psychopathy and narcissism with cyber controlling behaviors. Psychopathy was found to be strongly related with direct cyber aggression behaviors; sadism was mainly related with C-IPV victimization in both controlling and direct aggression, and, finally and interestingly, Machiavellianism presented negative correlations with direct cyber aggression. Remarkable is that joining sadistic personalities increased vulnerability to victimization from C-IPV direct aggression, as well as more psychopathic traits and an increased probability of perpetration. These combinations may create dangerous situations. In conclusion, we found that both C-IPV perpetrators and victims present higher scores in the dark personality traits and gender-based differences than in-person IPV actors. \textcopyright{} 2021 SAGE Publications.},

journal={Personality and Individual Differences},
abstract={Online trolling is of particular concern due to the harmful negative outcomes its victims experience. The current study sought to explore and extend the personality profile of Internet trolls. After gender was controlled for, psychopathy, sadism, and empathy (affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and social skills) were examined for their predictive utility of trolling behaviour. A sample of 415 participants (36\% men, 63\% women, 1\% other) with a mean age of 23.37 years (SD = 7.19) completed an online questionnaire. Results showed that men were more likely than women to engage in trolling, and higher levels of trait psychopathy and sadism predicted trolling behaviour. Lower levels of affective empathy predicted perpetration of trolling, and trait psychopathy moderated the association between cognitive empathy and trolling. Results indicate that when high on trait psychopathy, trolls employ an empathic strategy of predicting and recognising the emotional suffering of their victims, while abstaining from the experience of these negative emotions. Thus, trolls appear to be master manipulators of both cyber-settings and their victims' emotions. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Despite growing prevalence of derogatory online behaviors, still little is known about psychological factors underlying this negative phenomenon. In the present study, we aimed to compare characteristics of persons who post hating and non-hating comments about Polish sports players during Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang (2018) on the Internet. Ninety-four Internet users (41\% women) participated in the study, among which 46 posted hating comments. After 1 month, participants were invited to take part in a psychological survey, and filled the Dark Triad questionnaire, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Scale of Frustration, and the Scale of Envy. Results showed that high scores in Psychopathy subscale were significant predictors of posting hating comments online; high scores on the Envy Scale were marginally significant. Our findings provide initial evidence that persons who engage in derogatory online behavior have a high level of Psychopathy, but, contrary to previous studies, do not have elevated levels of other traits, commonly associated with disruptive behavior. Our research is one of the first to establish a psychological background of online haters, while setting a clear line between online hating and other derogatory online behaviors (e.g., trolling, cyber-bullying, or hatred speech). \textcopyright{} Copyright \textcopyright{} 2020 Sorokowski, Kowal, Zdybek and Oleszkiewicz.},

journal={Telematics and Informatics},
abstract={In this study, we want to conceptually and empirically distinguish those who deliberately seek to create division in an online forum by inauthentically voicing an anti-majority opinion\textemdash a specific type of ``online trolls,'' from the vocal minorities\textemdash those who speak out against the majority to express their unpopular viewpoint. 599 participants recruited from Amazon MTurk completed an online experiment. They were randomly assigned to post a comment after reading a series of either all positive or all negative reviews of a branded product. We coded participants' comments based on their preexisting attitude towards the product brand and grouped the participants into five behavioral types: 1) vocal and silent (normative) majorities (n = 235), 2) silent minorities (n = 75), 3) social conformers (n = 117), 4) vocal minorities (n = 95), and 5) ``online trolls'' (n = 46). Both vocal minorities and ``online trolls'' explicitly expressed opposition to the majority opinion, but the ``trolls'' spoke out against the majority opinion against their own beliefs. Based on past research, we identified Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism as the set of personality markers that might differentiate the trolls from the vocal minorities. Our results were mixed. As expected, the ``online trolls' scored the highest on psychopathy and sadism among all the behavioral types. However, the trolls were not distinguishable from the vocal minorities on the psychopathy trait. This study extends the existing literature on linking personality traits to technology-mediated social behavior. It also informs social research on online trolling and cyberactivism. \textcopyright{} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Cyber aggressive behavior among adolescents is a widespread concern. However, little is known about the influencing factors and psychological mechanism of cyber aggressive behavior in adolescents. This study examined whether dark personality traits would be associated with cyber aggression in adolescents, whether belief in virtuous humanity would mediate the relationship between dark personality traits and cyber aggression, and whether self-control would play a moderating role in the links. A total of 675 Chinese college students completed a series of anonymous questionnaires regarding dark personality traits, belief in virtuous humanity, self-control, and cyber aggression. Results showed the following: (1) dark personality was positively related to cyber aggression in adolescents; (2) belief in virtuous humanity mediated the relationship between dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism and psychopathy) and cyber aggression; (3) self-control play a moderating role in the relationship between dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism and psychopathy) and cyber aggression, and the relationship between belief in virtuous humanity and cyber aggression. This study could help demonstrate the risk and protective factors and psychological mechanism of cyber aggressive behavior in adolescents. Some theoretical and practical implications and limitations were also discussed. \textcopyright{} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},
