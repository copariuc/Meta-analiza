journal={Personality and Individual Differences},
abstract={Trolling behaviours on social networking sites (SNSs) are problematic for other computer mediated communication users, as the psychological effects of experiencing trolling online are considered similar to the psychological effects of offline harassment. The current study explored personality traits and social motivations associated with individuals who engage in online trolling, specifically on the SNS Facebook\textregistered. The Dark Tetrad personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism) and social reward (specifically, negative social potency) were examined for their predictive utility of trolling behaviours on Facebook\textregistered. A sample of 396 adults (75.9\% women, 24.1\% men) aged between 18 and 77years of age (M=34.41, SD=1.70) completed the Global Assessment of Facebook\textregistered{} Trolling (GAFT), The Dirty Dozen, The Short Sadistic Impulse Scale, and The Social Rewards Questionnaire. Results showed that trait psychopathy and sadism predict Facebook\textregistered{} trolling behaviours; however, negative social potency had the strongest predictive utility. These results show that individual trolling behaviour may be better explained by negative social reward motivation than negative personality traits. In addition, these findings offer practical implications for SNS administrators and everyday users of SNSs. Future research should continue to explore predictors of this understudied antisocial online behaviour.},

title={The Dark Triad and Facebook Surveillance: How Machiavellianism, Psychopathy, but Not Narcissism Predict Using Facebook to Spy on Others},
journal={Computers in Human Behavior},
abstract={The Dark Triad of personality \textendash{} Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy \textendash{} has been shown to influence a variety of behaviours. Typically, high levels of these traits predict engaging in behaviour at the periphery of what is considered socially normative. Such individuals do not display clinical maladaptation however, and function relatively normally. The Dark Triad's influence extends to the online context, where it predicts questionable behaviour when using social media such as Facebook. For example it can affect the content of users' status updates, or what media they post. In this paper we examine a new concept known as Facebook surveillance. This details the deliberate examination of users' profiles in order to gather information for one's own advantage. We suggest this is distinct with the conventional viewing of ones ``feed'' (which has little intent), or the stalking of ex-romantic partners (which has a emotive component). We predicted that Machiavellianism and psychopathy would both predict Facebook surveillance, whereas narcissism would not. Furthermore, we postulated that the Machiavellianism-surveillance relationship would be mediated by endorsement of gossip, whereas for psychopathy it would be mediated by intolerance for uncertainty. 259 participants took part in an online survey to measure these traits. Results supported our hypotheses, and suggested two forms of surveillance \textendash{} Facebook tracking, which was more recreational, and Facebook investigating, which was more deliberate and targeted. Future studies are then discussed which may use more complex measures of narcissism, and gather behavioural and/or qualitative measures of surveillance.},

title={Examining the Dark Tetrad and Its Links to Cyberbullying},
journal={Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking},
abstract={Cyberbullying is a growing problem in the fast-evolving world of social media. Although this problem has been studied extensively, there is relatively little research examining it from the angle of the dark tetrad (i.e., psychopathy, Machiavellianism, sadism, and narcissism), especially across different ethnicities. In other words, this research makes original contribution by exploring the predictive ability of the dark tetrad traits in individuals of different ethnicities and their subsequent willingness to engage in cyberbullying. The study (n = 1,464) explores whether there is a positive association between the dark tetrad personality traits and cyberbullying. The results reveal that all four traits predict cyberbullying in participants from across three different ethnicities (Asian, black, and white). Furthermore, female participants score less than their male counterparts across all four traits. Researchers, academics, and legislators might potentially benefit from this research by considering focusing their interventions on helping offenders minimize the display of certain personality traits, thus taking steps toward cyberbullying reduction. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.},

title={The Dark Tetrad Traits and Problematic Social Media Use: The Mediating Role of Cyberbullying and Cyberstalking},
journal={Personality and Individual Differences},
abstract={The Dark Tetrad traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, sadism) are associated with antisocial online behaviors. However, the mediating role of these behaviors between the Dark Tetrad and problematic social media use (PSMU) is unclear. Among a sample of 761 participants, we investigated direct and indirect associations of the Dark Tetrad traits with PSMU via cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and cybertrolling. Multiple mediation analyses demonstrated cyberbullying and cyberstalking fully mediated the relationship between Machiavellianism and PSMU in the total sample and among men. Narcissism was indirectly associated with PSMU via cyberstalking in the total sample and among women. The relationship between sadism and PSMU was fully explained by cyberbullying and cyberstalking in the total sample. Cybertrolling was associated with sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, although it was not related to PSMU. We suggest that antisocial online behaviors may provide an explanation for the relationship between dark personality traits and PSMU with different behaviors mediating different traits among men and women. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

title={High Esteem and Hurting Others Online: Trait Sadism Moderates the Relationship between Self-Esteem and Internet Trolling},
journal={Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking},
abstract={Internet trolling is commonly defined as disruptive online behavior, intended to provoke and distress others for amusement. Previous research has shown that gender (specifically, male), trait psychopathy, and trait sadism significantly predict engaging in trolling. In this study, we sought to replicate and extend previous research by exploring the role of self-esteem in predicting trolling, and possible interactions between self-esteem and personality. Participants (n = 400, 67.5 percent women, average age = 24.97 years [SD = 8.84]) completed an online questionnaire, including measures of psychopathy, sadism, self-esteem, and trolling behaviors. Results corroborated previous research showing gender (male) to be a significant predictor of trolling, and trait psychopathy and sadism to be significant positive predictors. Although self-esteem had no additional value on top of trait psychopathy and sadism in explaining trolling, there was a significant interaction between self-esteem and trait sadism. A moderation analysis indicated a positive relationship between self-esteem and trolling, but only when trait sadism was high. These results portray the troll as a callous individual may enjoy causing psychological harm, particularly if their self-esteem is high. These results contribute to building the psychological profile of trolls and provide future directions for research exploring trolling behaviors. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.},
